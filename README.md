## **Project Title**

**Zambia Citizen Feedback Platform: Empowering Citizens and Government Employees through Inclusive Digital Engagement**

---

## **Executive Summary**

The Zambia Citizen Feedback Platform is a national initiative designed to enhance public participation, transparency, and accountability in governance. By providing a multi-channel communication platform—including web, mobile app, SMS, and USSD services—the project aims to empower citizens and government employees to submit feedback, report urgent issues, and share ideas related to national development directly with relevant authorities. The integration of emergency alert features allows for rapid reporting of critical matters at government facilities, and enables government employees in remote areas to voice concerns when other reporting channels are ineffective. Advanced functionalities like data classification, sentiment analysis, and real-time dashboards facilitate efficient handling and analysis of feedback, enabling the government to make informed, data-driven decisions promptly.
