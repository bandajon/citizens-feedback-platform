## **Detailed Pipeline Steps**

### **1. Code Commit and Version Control**

- **Developers** write code and commit changes to the **Git** repository hosted on **GitHub** or **GitLab**.
- Branching strategies (e.g., **GitFlow**) are used to manage feature development, releases, and hotfixes.

```plaintext
[Developer] 
    │
    ├── Commits Code
    │
[Version Control System (Git)]
```

### **2. Continuous Integration (CI)**

#### **a. Code Checkout**

- The CI server (e.g., **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI/CD**, **Azure DevOps Pipelines**) detects the commit and checks out the latest code from the repository.

```plaintext
[CI Server]
    ├── Triggers on Code Commit
    │
    └── Checks out Code from Git
```

#### **b. Build and Compile**

- The code is compiled using appropriate build tools (e.g., **Go Compiler** for Golang).
- Dependencies are resolved and managed (e.g., using **Go Modules**).

```plaintext
[CI Server]
    └── Builds and Compiles Code
```

#### **c. Static Code Analysis**

- Tools like **GolangCI-Lint** are used to perform static code analysis to detect code smells, potential bugs, and enforce coding standards.

```plaintext
[CI Server]
    └── Performs Static Code Analysis
```

#### **d. Unit Testing**

- Unit tests are executed to validate individual components.
- Code coverage reports are generated to assess test effectiveness.

```plaintext
[CI Server]
    └── Runs Unit Tests
        └── Generates Code Coverage Reports
```

**Decision Point:**

- If any of the above steps fail, the pipeline aborts, and developers are notified to fix the issues.
- If all steps pass, the pipeline proceeds to the next stage.

### **3. Artifact Packaging**

#### **a. Docker Image Creation**

- A **Docker image** of the application is built using a **Dockerfile**.
- The image includes all necessary runtime dependencies.

```plaintext
[CI Server]
    └── Builds Docker Image
```

#### **b. Push to Container Registry**

- The Docker image is tagged (e.g., with build number or commit hash) and pushed to a **Container Registry** (e.g., **Docker Hub**, **Azure Container Registry**).

```plaintext
[CI Server]
    └── Pushes Docker Image to Container Registry
```

### **4. Continuous Deployment (CD)**

#### **a. Deploy to Staging Environment**

- Using **Infrastructure as Code** tools (e.g., **Kubernetes manifests**, **Helm charts**), the Docker image is deployed to the **Staging Environment**.
- Deployment strategies like **Rolling Updates** or **Blue-Green Deployments** can be used.

```plaintext
[CD Pipeline]
    └── Deploys to Staging Environment
```

#### **b. Integration and System Testing**

- Automated integration tests are run to validate interactions between components.
- End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios.

```plaintext
[Staging Environment]
    └── Runs Integration and System Tests
```

#### **c. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

- The **Product Manager** and stakeholders perform UAT to ensure the application meets business requirements.

```plaintext
[Staging Environment]
    └── User Acceptance Testing by Stakeholders
```

**Decision Point:**

- If tests fail, defects are logged, and the pipeline halts until issues are resolved.
- If tests pass, approval is given to deploy to production.

#### **d. Deploy to Production Environment**

- The application is deployed to the **Production Environment** following approved deployment procedures.
- Configuration settings are adjusted for the production context.

```plaintext
[CD Pipeline]
    └── Deploys to Production Environment
```

### **5. Monitoring and Feedback**

#### **a. Application Performance Monitoring**

- Tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** are used to monitor application performance, resource utilization, and response times.

```plaintext
[Production Environment]
    └── Monitors Application Performance
```

#### **b. Logging and Alerting**

- Centralized logging with tools like **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or **Graylog**.
- Alerts are configured to notify the team of any critical issues.

```plaintext
[Monitoring Tools]
    ├── Collect Logs
    └── Send Alerts on Anomalies
```

#### **c. Continuous Feedback Loop**

- Feedback from monitoring tools and user reports is collected.
- Insights are used to create new tasks or user stories in the backlog.

```plaintext
[Feedback Loop]
    ├── Collects Monitoring Data
    ├── Gathers User Feedback
    └── Feeds into Backlog for Continuous Improvement
```
