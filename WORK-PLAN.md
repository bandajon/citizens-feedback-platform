## **Assumptions and Considerations**

- **Single Developer Constraints:** The plan is designed with realistic daily workloads for one developer, considering an average of 8 working hours per day.

- **Communication with External Services:** Early in Week 1, ensure that access to external APIs (OpenAI, Zamtel SMS, Google Maps) is established to avoid delays.

- **Testing:** Allocate sufficient time for testing to ensure the reliability and security of the application.

- **Flexibility:** The developer should remain flexible to adjust tasks based on progress and any unforeseen challenges.

- **Deployment Environment:** It's assumed that the deployment environment (e.g., Kubernetes cluster) is accessible and that necessary permissions are in place.

---

## **Post-Implementation Activities**

- **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Set up monitoring tools to observe the application's performance in production and plan for ongoing maintenance.

- **User Feedback:** Establish channels to receive feedback from initial users to guide future improvements.

- **Feature Enhancements:** Identify and prioritize additional features or improvements based on project goals and user needs.
